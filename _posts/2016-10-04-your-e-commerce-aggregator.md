# Online Shopping Aggregator

The making of **Online Shopping Aggregator** just started. It's a platform that will target busy online shoppers that wold like to take the make the most of their time.

Almost everything can now be ordered online but for many online shoppers it gets very time consuming to do it properly: searching back and forth multiple products and offers, getting to know the best suppliers for the kind of products they need and making sure that they never run out of supplies. And the cherry on the top pf the cake: the web is infested with clutter and spam that only makes the shopping experience slower and misleading.

So I've decided to make the browser more clever and expand it to an assistant for online shopping, so that you can train it with your own lifestyle rules and filters, and in return it will bring you quick access to:

* Price discovery
* Product discovery
* Supplier discovery
* History discovery

Then you can act on this information to:

* Compare products and prices
* Learn about more suitable suppliers
* Predict recurring orders based on your history

Now, a little bit more about these features.

The Aggregator searches simultaneously for multiple products in multiple stores. It does that in a very reactive/dynamic way while you continue working so that no time is wasted waiting for the results, and all data is returned in real-time.

Then it uses powerful filters and your orders history to help you find the kind of product that suits to your specific needs or lifestyle. Ex: Organic Food in Tesco and Organic Supermarket.

It allows you to easily add/remove items from the store's shopping cart and once you decide to submit your order(s) it redirects you to their website for a proper checkout. So no credit card is ever requested from you.

## Technology Wise

I'll use again the same concept of "Browser-As-A-Service", as I did for [Your Money Aggregator][0], to provide the best possible online shopping experience. Your browser gets enhanced, it gets to know how to interact fast and efficiently with all those online stores and it is fully reactive so that you get to see the result of your actions immediately.
