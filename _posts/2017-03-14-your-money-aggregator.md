It supports Personal AIB bank accounts. Your personal data is never saved and the only way you can get your statements out is by exporting them to a CSV file, using the save button. </p></article>

After exporting to CSV, you can then use it with:

* [You Need A Budget][0] online app, makes you Gain Total Control of Your Money, paying off debt, saving more money, and breaking the paycheck cycle.
* [Qlik Sense(r) Desktop or Qlik Sense(r) Cloud][1], a revolutionary free self-service application that will provide hi-tech visualization and discovery of your expenditures. You can download our Money Aggregator Qlik Sense app ([here][2]) and then upload it into your cloud account, and then use the Data Load Editor to upload your CSV file.
