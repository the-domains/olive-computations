How do you translate business into code?

This was the first time I gave a lecture on Eric Evan's book _Domain-Driven Design - Tackling Complexity in The Heart of Software._ It was back in 2011 and concepts suck as Microservices and CQRS were not very popular yet. Nevertheless I managed to put some material together and make sense of it and even answer some "more advanced" questions on the matter. Sorry that the lecture in Portuguese language. If you have any questions drop me an email and I'll answer.
