  This was the first time I gave a lecture about Eric Evan’s book, Domain-Driven
  Design - Tackling Complexity in The Heart of Software. It was back in 2011
  when concepts such as Microservices and CQRS were not that much popular yet.
  Nevertheless I managed to put some material together in a meaningful way and
  answer some “more advanced” questions on the matter. Sorry that the lecture
  was in Portuguese. If you have any questions about DDD drop me an email and
  I’ll answer back: joao(at)nicolauoliveira.com
